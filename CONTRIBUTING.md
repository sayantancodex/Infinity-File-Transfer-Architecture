## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug in the project, please help us by reporting it. Here's how:

1. **Search for existing issues**: Before reporting a new bug, please check if it has already been reported.
2. **Create a new issue**: If you can't find an existing issue, create a new one using the [bug report template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md).
3. **Provide detailed information**: Include a clear title, description, and steps to reproduce the bug. If possible, add screenshots or logs to help us understand the issue.

### Suggesting Features

If you have an idea for a new feature or improvement, we'd love to hear about it! Here's how you can suggest a feature:
